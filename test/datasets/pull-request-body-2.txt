## Ticket scope

This feature has 3 goals for the "edit a product" / "specific prices" panel:
- move the "add a specific price" form above the specific prices list
- move the javascript code which handles this form behavior into new-theme
- enable a "edit a specific price" button which opens a form in a pop-in

A 4th goal was added during the development as I found a bug on this form. I reported it in the forge (http://forge.prestashop.com/browse/BOOM-6300) and solved it in this PR.

This PR replaces https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/9388 as the previous PR did not use a pop-in. The spec changed so I created a new PR. However I fixed the requested changes of the previous PR in this new PR.

## How to test

Go on a "Edit a product" page on the BackOffice for 1 product. Click on "add a specific price" to display a form which allows to create specific prices. Create 2 or 3 of them so that you have a listing of prices with multiple items in it.

Now you can check that:
- When you click on the "add a specific price" button a new form appears **above** the listing
- When you click on the "edit" icon for 1 price, a pop-in appears with a form in it pre-filled with the settings of the selected price. You can modify the settings and click on "apply" to modify the price. Check the different buttons work correctly.

**Be careful:** in multi-shop context another field appears in the form. Also products with combination have another form field that single-combination products do not display. So test with a product with combinations and with a product without.
